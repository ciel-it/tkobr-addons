1.3	* Set 18,2016 : ThinkOpen Solutions Brasil
    * Automatic outgoing SMTP mail server detection: Through the [From] address of outgoing message,
    Odoo will select correct outgoing SMTP mail server to send email. This way if there is a SMTP mail
    server equal to the current user email, Odoo will use that outgoing email server to send the email.
    Template compatibility: If one sets From field in the email template Odoo will send that email
    from that outgoing SMTP server, if defined, if not it will use standard system parameter and outgoing
    email servers priority.
    NOTE: Don't forget, now you need to set explicitly the From and Reply-to fields in all
    email templates. And create always the incoming mail server of the respective outgoing one.
    The Reply-to will always be equal to From email (even if defined in template Reply-to field) if an
    outgoing email server is defined, if not it will use standard system parameter, like in standard
    Odoo.
    Backward compatibility:
        * All fields are kept in database, although not shown in forms, until new version is released.
        No data will be lost, and one can revert to older module version. NOTE: They will
        be removed in 3.0 version.

1.0	* Set 16,2016 : ThinkOpen Solutions Brasil
    * The module set following HEADERS according to user SMTP server:
        * UserName <SMTP_Server_User_Name_Email>
        * Reply-To: UserName <SMTP_Server_User_Name_Email>
        * Return-Path: UserName <SMTP_Server_User_Name_Email>
    * This will fix a problem connecting to servers like for example Zoho.
    * But will override email in templates From and Reply-to fields.
